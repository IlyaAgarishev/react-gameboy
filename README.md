### About
The main idea was to create my own game logic without using canvas or any side game library. Snake üêç mechanics is written with help of custom written hooks. So the whole game engine is just written with pure js and react. [Below you can find more information about how this whole mechanism works.](https://github.com/IlyaAgarishev/react-gameboy#how-it-works)

### How it works
All logic is broken down into several hooks: `useSnakeMotion`, `useSnakeHasFailed`, `useSnakeColor`, `useRandomFoodCoordinate`, `useLastControlKeyPressed`. And the main hook `useSnake` simply combines the work of above hooks.

Then `GameplayScreen` component calls useSnake hook 
```javascript
const snakeData = useSnake();
```
So `snakeData` contains all the information needed to render the whole game snake logic in UI.
The `snakeData` is rendered on the special ui grid.

The grid is just a matrix with a size of 144 elements:
```javascript
const sizeOfMatrix: number = 144;
const matrix: Array<number> = [...Array(sizeOfMatrix)].map((el, i) => i);
```
